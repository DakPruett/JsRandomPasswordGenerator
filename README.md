Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to Create a program to simulate random passcodes, removing the need for people to need to create them themselves.
I built this project to learn better how JavaScript works as well as implementing JHTML and CSS in the samre structure. Im hoping it will hwlp cut down on people needing to think of passwords especially if they changew them alot and need them randomized. Making this I learned a lot about JavaScript and how certain functions work internally.
Throughout this project i learned more efficiently how JavaScript functions and how to properly implement some of the techniques themselves.
